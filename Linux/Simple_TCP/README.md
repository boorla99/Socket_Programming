# Linux TCP Socket Sample

This sample shows you how to a use stream (TCP) socket to send and receive data using the TCP Socket in your linux environment.

The client component of the sample creates a TCP socket to make a network connection, uses the socket to send data, and closes the socket. The server component sets up a TCP listener that provides a connected socket for every incoming network connection, uses the socket to receive data from the client, and closes the socket. This sample is provided in the C programming language.
